# Graph building documentation

This repository contains documentation about the effort of collecting structured data from public sources, joining into a shared graph and distributing in an easy-to-use format.

There are several documentation pieces one for each step:

* [Collecting data](collecting.md)
* [Merging data](merging.md)
* [Distributing result graph](distributing.md)
